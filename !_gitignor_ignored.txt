Even if you haven't tracked the files so far, Git seems to be able to "know" about them even after you add them to .gitignore.

WARNING: First commit or stash your current changes, or you will lose them.

Then run the following commands from the top folder of your Git repository:


git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "fixed untracked files"

==============================================

Update remote branch:
 
git push origin feature
